# KIVA-API-Javascript-Project
Javascript term project using the KIVA API

This javascript program was written as a term project for a course in javascript.

* uses the KIVA API
* refreshes every 10 seconds
* computes various statistics from the API call (last 100 lending actions on the KIVA website).

* to run, load index.html in browser. (I have only tested it locally on my own Macintosh, running MAMP; I did test with several browsers including Macintosh Chrome and Firefox and Windows Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and IE.)

Some additional notes and details in the accompanying pdf file.
