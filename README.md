# KIVA-API-Javascript-Project
Javascript term project using the KIVA API

This javascript program was written as a term project for a course in javascript.

* uses the KIVA API
* refreshes every 10 seconds
* computes various statistics from the API call (last 100 lending actions on the KIVA website).

To run basic page, load index.html in browser. (I have only tested it locally on my own Macintosh, running MAMP; I did test with several browsers including Macintosh Chrome and Firefox and Windows Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and IE.)
Unfortunately, right now I don't know how to make the call to the API work on github (the part in the php file). If you have MAMP or some other way to run that, you could download the entire thing and run it locally.

Some additional notes and details in the accompanying pdf file.
